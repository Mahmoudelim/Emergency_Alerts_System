# Emergency_Alerts_System

The Medical Emergency Classification project is a mobile application that leverages machine learning and Firebase integration to classify medical emergency cases based on input symptoms. This project aims to provide prompt and accurate emergency classification to assist healthcare professionals in making critical decisions during urgent situations.

## Project Overview

In emergency medical situations, timely and accurate classification of cases is crucial for effective patient care. The Medical Emergency Classification project utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to analyze input symptoms and classify them into different emergency categories such as cardiac arrest, stroke, trauma, respiratory distress, and more. The mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for symptom input, and the classification model is deployed as a cloud function in Firebase for efficient and scalable performance.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, for accurate classification of medical emergencies.
- Mobile application framework for seamless symptom input and emergency classification.
- Integration with Firebase for real-time data synchronization, authentication, and cloud storage.
- Cloud function deployment of the classification model for efficient and scalable performance.
- Supports user profiles, medical history tracking, and emergency contact information.
- Provides notifications and alerts for critical emergency cases.

## Technology Stack

- Mobile Framework: Android (Java/Kotlin)
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for model training)
- Backend Framework: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions)
- Cloud Deployment: Firebase Cloud Functions
- Real-time Database and Synchronization: Firebase Realtime Database
- Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage
